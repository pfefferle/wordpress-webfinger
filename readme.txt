WebFinger for WordPress

== Description ==

Enables WebFinger ([RFC 7033](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033)) support for WordPress.

About WebFinger:

> WebFinger is used to discover information about people or other entities on the Internet that are identified by a URI using standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods over a secure transport.  A WebFinger resource returns a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object describing the entity that is queried. The JSON object is referred to as the JSON Resource Descriptor (JRD).

(quote from the [RFC](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033))

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to extend the JRD file =

You can add your own links or properties like that:

    function oexchange_target_link( $array ) {
      $array["links"][] = array( 'rel' => 'http://oexchange.org/spec/0.8/rel/resident-target',
        'href' => 'http://example.com',
        'type' => 'application/xrd+xml' );
      return $array;
    }
    add_filter( 'webfinger_data', 'oexchange_target_link' );

= Add alternate file/output formats =

You can add your own links or properties like that:

    function render_xrd($webfinger) {
      // set custom header();

      // JRD to XRD code

      exit;
    }
    add_action( 'webfinger_render', 'render_xrd', 5 );
